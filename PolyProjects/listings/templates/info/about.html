							<p>PolyProjects is an online tool for Cal Poly students/faculty to connect and form teams. You can either post an idea and list who you are looking for, or you can browse current project and join one of those.</p>
						<h4>Who we are</h4>
						<p><img src="images/kat.jpg"></p>
						<p>Kat, <em>Designer/Founder</em></p>
						<p>
							 Kat came up with this idea in her senior project class when she was trying to come up with something awesome to do, but didn't have any ideas. She wished Cal Poly had an online tool to browse current projects around campus that could use her design skills. And that's how PolyProjects was born. Kat is currently a Graphic Communication senior with a concentration in Design Reproduction Technology and a minor in Media Arts and Technologies. She is graduating in December 2014.

								 Rishab is the developer in charge of making sure this whole site works properly. He and Kat met at the Cal Poly Design and Dev Hackathon where they created their first prototype of the site. Rishab is a Computer Science freshman.</p>
